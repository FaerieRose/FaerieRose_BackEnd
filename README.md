# FaerieRose WebPage BackEnd

This is a project that is under construction. Using Maven, SpringBoot and Java, I am creating the database and ReSTfull service for my WebPage. The WebPage will contain my CV and the book I am writing. It will have an option for logging in to give feedback on my book.

## Tools

There are several tools that I use to create the BackEnd. All the Java coding is done in Eclipse. As everything is still in the development phase, I use XAMPP for the Apache and MySQL. For testing the ReST services I use Postman. Git Bash is used to send all my code over here. The Class Diagrams I created using yEd. 

## Process

Before starting on this project, I made drawings of the WebPages and decided on the content I would like to show. I know that a complete BackEnd is overkill. All the WebPages can be created just using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The decision for this BackEnd is made to show possible future employers what my current skill level is.

Knowing what I wanted to do, I started working on the ClassDiagrams in yEd (https://www.yworks.com/products/yed). Once those were completed, I went to https://start.spring.io/ to create my pom.xml file. The GitHub repository was created and the .gitignore file updated. This was important because some code I do not want share for security reasons. The next step is creating the project in Eclipse and start coding.
